This is a collection of __all__ my knowlege! Well, coding knowledge mostly. There might be some oddities sprinkiled in here and there.


## File Structure
### Archive
This is where I store old or "stale" code. Really it's just where I put code to clean things up and get it outta my way. Yeaah, I'm lazy but wanted to keep all my commit history so this was the __chosen__ option.

### Matrices
This is where all the most "up to date" code, if you will, lives cuz that's where I'll be doing the latest work. I'm a simple guy, what can I say.
