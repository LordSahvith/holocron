                            agree that the following terms replace and supersede any additional conflicting terms submitted with your
                            Purchase Order and are the only terms under which PROVO CRAFT will sell or license its products ("Products")
                            to you.</p>
                        <h3>Payment terms and conditions of sale:</h3>
                        <p class="p2">Prices for Products are those set out in PROVO CRAFT’s current Price List, less the applicable
                            discount, if offered. PROVO CRAFT may modify the Price List at any time, including changes to the Products
                            or their corresponding list prices. All Product prices include delivery from the PROVO CRAFT warehouse to
                            your carrier, at which point title and risk of loss to the Products will pass to You. Except as may be
                            specifically authorized in writing by PROVO CRAFT, and subject to PROVO CRAFT’s continuing approval of your
                            credit status and financial condition, you will pay PROVO CRAFT for all Products ordered by within thirty

                            terms. All payments are to be made in US dollars. If at any time you are delinquent in the payment of any
                            invoice, exceed the credit line established by PROVO CRAFT, or are otherwise in breach of the Purchase
                            Order, PROVO CRAFT may, in its discretion, withhold shipment (including partial shipments) of any order or
                            may require you to pay cash on delivery for further shipments. Payment not received by PROVO CRAFT when due
                            may be subject to a late payment service charge.</p>
                        <h3>Product Returns:</h3>
                        <p class="p2">It is Provo Craft’s policy that all sales are final; however in limited instances a return may
                            be authorized. Prior to returning any inventory you must obtain a Return Material Authorization (RMA) number

                        <p class="p2">PROVO CRAFT warrants to the end-user that each item of hardware ("Hardware") will be free from
                            defects in workmanship and materials for its respective warranty period, which begins on the date of
                            purchase by the end-user. End-users’ exclusive remedy and PROVO CRAFT’s sole obligation and liability under
                            this warranty is to promptly repair or replace any failed Hardware returned to You on behalf of an end-user
                            because of defects in workmanship or material.</p>

                            updated by PROVO CRAFT and properly installed and operated on the Hardware or other equipment it is
                            originally licensed for, will function during its respective warranty period substantially as described in
                            the user documentation supplied by PROVO CRAFT with the Software. If any item of Software fails to so
                            perform during its warranty period, as the sole remedy PROVO CRAFT or PROVO CRAFT’s supplier will at its
                            discretion provide a suitable fix, patch or workaround for the problem, which may be included in a future
                            revision of the Software.</p>
                        <h3>Limitations:</h3>
                        <p class="p2">These warranties do not apply to any Product which has been (i) altered, except by PROVO CRAFT

                            in the defect, or (iii) damaged by improper environment, abuse, misuse, accident or negligence. Replacement
                            parts furnished under this warranty may be refurbished or contain refurbished components. The foregoing
                            warranties and limitations are exclusive remedies and are in lieu of all other warranties express or
                            implied, including without any limitation warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

                            malfunction of the Products, loss of profits or revenues or costs of replacement goods, even if PROVO CRAFT
                            is informed in advance of the possibility of such damages. Except as required by law, in no event will PROVO
                            CRAFT’s liability in connection with the Products or this Purchase Order exceed the amounts actually paid to
                            PROVO CRAFT under this Purchase Order for the Products giving rise to such liability. These limitations
                            apply to all causes of action in the aggregate. No action may be brought or arbitration demanded at any time

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. DELIVERY.</span> Time is of the essence. Delivery of Goods
                            shall be made pursuant to the schedule, via the carrier and to the place specified on the face of the
                            applicable purchase order and in compliance with Cricut’s Vendor Logistics Guide. Cricut reserves the right
                            to return, collect shipping charges, all Goods received in advance of the delivery schedule. If no delivery
                            schedule is specified, the order shall be filled promptly and delivery will be made by the most expeditious
                            form of land transportation. If no method of shipment is specified in the purchase order, Seller shall use
                            the least expensive carrier. In the event Seller fails to deliver the Goods within the time specified,
                            Cricut may, at its option, decline to accept the Goods and terminate the Agreement or may demand its
                            allocable fair share of Seller's available Goods and terminate the balance of the Agreement. Seller shall
                            package all items in suitable containers to permit safe transportation and handling. Each delivered
                            container must be labeled and marked to identify contents without opening and all boxes and packages must
                            contain packing sheets listing contents. Cricut's purchase order number must appear on all shipping
                            containers, packing sheets, delivery tickets and bills of lading.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. IDENTIFICATION, RISK OF LOSS &amp; DESTRUCTION OF
                                GOODS.</span> Identification of the Goods shall occur in accordance with Cricut’s Vendor Logistics Guide,
                            or as otherwise specified by Cricut. Seller assumes all risk of loss until receipt by Cricut. Title to the
                            Goods shall pass to Cricut upon receipt by it of the Goods at the designated destination. If the Goods
                            ordered are destroyed prior to title passing to Cricut, Cricut may at its option cancel the Agreement or
                            require delivery of substitute Goods of equal quantity and quality. Such delivery will be made as soon as
                            commercially practicable. If loss of Goods is partial, Cricut shall have the right to require delivery of
                            the Goods not destroyed.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. PAYMENT.</span> As full consideration for the delivery of the
                            Goods and the assignment of rights to Cricut as provided herein, Cricut shall pay Seller the amount agreed
                            upon and specified in the applicable purchase order. Applicable taxes and other charges such as shipping
                            costs, duties, customs, tariffs, imposts and government imposed surcharges shall be stated separately on
                            Seller's invoice. Payment is made when Cricut's check is mailed. Payment shall not constitute acceptance.
                            All personal property taxes assessable upon the Goods prior to receipt by Cricut of Goods conforming to the
                            purchase order shall be borne by Seller. Seller shall invoice Cricut for all Goods delivered and all
                            Services actually performed. Each invoice submitted by Seller must be provided to Cricut within ninety (90)
                            days of delivery of Goods and must reference the applicable purchase order, and Cricut reserves the right to
                            return all incorrect invoices. Unless otherwise specified on the face of a purchase order, Cricut shall pay
                            the invoiced amount within sixty (60) days after receipt of a correct invoice.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. WARRANTIES.</span> Seller warrants that all Goods provided
                            will be new and will not be used or refurbished. Seller warrants that all Goods delivered shall be free from
                            defects in materials, design and workmanship and shall conform to all applicable specifications for a period
                            of fifteen (15) months from the date of delivery to Cricut or for the period provided in Seller's standard
                            warranty covering the Goods, whichever is longer. Furthermore, the Products will be free from defects and
                            materials which could create a hazard to life or property; the Products will conform in all respects with
                            all applicable international, federal, state, agency, and local laws, orders, and regulations, including,
                            without limitation, those regarding: (a) safety, (b) content, (c) flammability, (d) weights, measures, and
                            sizes, (e) processing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, selling, shipping, and invoicing, (f)
                            registration and declaration of responsibility, (g) occupational safety and health, and (h) noise, radio and
                            electromagnetic emissions. If requested by Cricut in the Purchase Order, Seller hereby agrees that it will
                            make spare parts available to Cricut for a period of five (5) years from the date of shipment at Sellers
                            then current price. Additionally, Goods purchased shall be subject to all written express warranties made by
                            Seller's agents. All warranties shall be construed as conditions as well as warranties and shall not be
                            exclusive. Seller shall furnish to Cricut Seller's standard warranty and service guaranty applicable to the
                            Goods. All warranties and Service guaranties shall run both to Cricut and to its customers.</p>

                        <p class="p2">If Cricut identifies a warranty problem with the Goods during the warranty period, Cricut will
                            promptly notify Seller of such problems and will return the Goods to Seller, at Seller's expense. Within
                            five (5) business days of receipt of the returned Goods, Seller shall, at Cricut's option, either repair or
                            replace such Goods, or credit Cricut's account for the same.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Replacement and repaired Goods shall be warranted for the remainder of the warranty period or
                            six (6) months, whichever is longer.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6. INSPECTION.</span> Cricut shall have a reasonable time after
                            receipt of Goods or Service deliverables and before payment to inspect them for conformity hereto, and Goods
                            received prior to inspection shall not be deemed accepted until Cricut has run an adequate test to determine
                            whether the Goods conform to the specifications hereof. Use of a portion of the Goods for the purpose of
                            testing shall not constitute an acceptance of the Goods. If Goods tendered do not wholly conform with the
                            provisions hereof, Cricut shall have the right to reject such Goods. Nonconforming Goods will be returned to
                            Seller freight collect and risk of loss will pass to Seller upon Cricut's delivery to the common carrier.
                        </p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">7. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.</span> Seller is an independent
                            contractor for all purposes, without express or implied authority to bind Cricut by contract or otherwise.
                            Neither Seller nor its employees, agents or subcontractors ("Seller's Assistants") are agents or employees
                            of Cricut.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8. SELLER RESPONSIBLE FOR TAXES AND RECORDS.</span> Seller shall
                            be solely responsible for filing the appropriate federal, state and local tax forms, and paying all such
                            taxes or fees, including estimated taxes and employment taxes, due with respect to Seller's receipt of
                            payment under this Agreement. Seller further agrees to provide Cricut with reasonable assistance in the
                            event of a government audit. Cricut shall have no responsibility to pay or withhold from any payment to
                            Seller under this Agreement, any federal, state or local taxes or fees.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">9. INSURANCE.</span> Seller shall be solely responsible for
                            maintaining liability, and other insurance, as is required by law or as is the common practice in Seller's
                            trades or businesses, whichever affords greater coverage. Upon request, Seller shall provide Cricut with
                            certificates of insurance or evidence of coverage before commencing performance under this Agreement. Seller
                            shall provide adequate coverage for any Cricut property under the care, custody or control of Seller.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">10. INDEMNITY.</span> Seller shall indemnify, hold harmless, and
                            at Cricut's request, defend Cricut, its officers, directors, customers, agents and employees, against all
                            claims, liabilities, damages, losses and expenses, including attorneys' fees and cost of suit arising out of
                            or in any way connected with the Goods or Services provided under this Agreement, including, without
                            limitation, (i) any claim based on the death or bodily injury to any person, destruction or damage to
                            property, or contamination of the environment and any associated clean up costs, (ii) any claim based on the
                            negligence, omissions or willful misconduct of Seller or any Seller's Assistants, and (iii) except where a
                            design, or specification, is provided by Cricut, any claim by a third party against Cricut alleging that the
                            Goods or Services, the results of such Services, or any other products or processes provided under this
                            Agreement, infringe a patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary right of a third
                            party, whether such are provided alone or in combination with other products, software or processes. Seller
                            shall not settle any such suit or claim without Cricut's prior written approval. Seller agrees to pay or
                            reimburse all costs that may be incurred by Cricut in enforcing this indemnity, including attorneys' fees.
                        </p>

                        <p class="p2">Should Cricut's use, or use by its distributors, subcontractors or customers, of any Goods or
                            Services purchased from Seller be enjoined, be threatened by injunction, or be the subject of any legal
                            proceeding, Seller shall, at is sole cost and expense, either (a) substitute fully equivalent non-infringing
                            Goods or Services; (b) modify the Goods or Services so that they no longer infringe but remain fully
                            equivalent in functionality; (c) obtain for Cricut, its distributors, subcontractors or customers the right
                            to continue using the Goods or Services; or (d) if none of the foregoing is possible, refund all amounts
                            paid for the infringing Goods or Services.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11. CONFIDENTIALITY.</span> Seller will acquire knowledge of
                            Cricut Confidential Information (as defined below) in connection with its performance hereunder and agrees
                            to keep such Cricut Confidential Information in confidence during and following termination or expiration of
                            this Agreement. "Cricut Confidential Information" includes but is not limited to all information, whether
                            written or oral, in any form, including without limitation, information relating to the research,
                            development, products, methods of manufacture, trade secrets, business plans, customers, vendors, finances,
                            personnel data, Work Product (as defined herein) and other material or information considered proprietary by
                            Cricut relating to the current or anticipated business or affairs of Cricut which is disclosed directly or
                            indirectly to Seller. In addition, Cricut Confidential Information means any third party's proprietary or
                            confidential information disclosed to Seller in the course of providing Services or Goods to Cricut. Cricut
                            Confidential Information does not include any information (i) which Seller lawfully knew without restriction
                            on disclosure before Cricut disclosed it to Seller, (ii) which is now or becomes publicly known through no
                            wrongful act or failure to act of Seller, (iii) which Seller developed independently without use of the
                            Cricut Confidential Information, as evidenced by appropriate documentation.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12. OWNERSHIP OF WORK PRODUCT.</span> For purposes of this
                            Agreement, "Work Product" shall include, without limitation, all designs, discoveries, creations, works,
                            devices, masks, models, work in progress, inventions, products, improvements, developments, drawings, notes,
                            documents, business processes, information and materials made, conceived or developed by Seller alone or
                            with others which result from or relate to the Goods provided hereunder. Standard Goods manufactured by
                            Seller and sold to Cricut without having been designed, customized or modified for Cricut do not constitute
                            Work Product. All Work Product shall at all times be and remain the sole and exclusive property of Cricut.
                            Seller hereby agrees to irrevocably assign and transfer to Cricut and does hereby assign and transfer to
                            Cricut all of its worldwide right, title and interest in and to the Work Product including all associated
                            intellectual property rights. Seller agrees: (a) to disclose promptly in writing to Cricut all Work Product
                            in its possession; (b) to assist Cricut in every reasonable way, at Cricut's expense, to secure, perfect,
                            register, apply for, maintain, and defend for Cricut's benefit all copyrights, patent rights, mask work
                            rights, trade secret rights, and all other proprietary rights or statutory protections in and to the Work
                            Product in Cricut's name as it deems appropriate; and (c) to otherwise treat all Work Product as Cricut
                            Confidential Information as described above. These obligations to disclose, assist, execute and keep
                            confidential survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. All tools and equipment supplied by
                            Cricut to Seller shall remain the sole property of Cricut.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">13. TERMINATION.</span> Cricut may terminate this Agreement upon
                            written notice. In the event of such termination, Cricut shall pay Seller for the portion of those
                            conforming Goods delivered to Cricut through the date of termination, less appropriate offsets.</p>

                        <p class="p2">Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement: (a) each party will be released from all
                            obligations to the other arising after the date of expiration or termination, except for those which by
                            their terms survive such termination or expiration; and (b) Seller will promptly notify Cricut of all Cricut
                            Confidential Information or any Work Product in Seller's possession and, at the expense of Seller and in
                            accordance with Cricut's instructions, will promptly deliver to Cricut all such Cricut Confidential
                            Information and/or Work Product.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">14. FORCE MAJEURE.</span> Cricut shall not be liable for any
                            failure to perform including failure to take delivery of the Goods as provided caused by circumstances
                            beyond its control which make such performance commercially impractical including, but not limited to, acts
                            of God, fire, flood, acts of war, government action, accident, labor difficulties or shortage, inability to
                            obtain materials, equipment or transportation. In the event Cricut is so excused, either party may terminate
                            the Agreement and Cricut shall at its expense and risk, return any Goods received to the place of shipment.
                        </p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15. SEVERABILITY.</span> If any provision of this Agreement
                            shall be deemed to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
                            remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">16. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</span> IN NO EVENT SHALL CRICUT BE
                            LIABLE TO SELLER OR SELLER'S ASSISTANTS, OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR
                            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER OR NOT CRICUT WAS
                            ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">17. ASSIGNMENT; WAIVER.</span> Seller may not assign this
                            Agreement or any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of
                            Cricut. Any assignment or transfer without such written consent shall be null and void. This Agreement shall
                            inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors and assigns of Cricut without restriction. A
                            waiver of any default hereunder or of any term or condition of this Agreement shall not be deemed to be a
                            continuing waiver or a waiver of any other default or any other term or condition.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">18. NON-EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT.</span> This is not an exclusive
                            Agreement. Cricut is free to engage others to perform Services or provide Goods the same as or similar to
                            Seller's. Seller is free to, and is encouraged to, advertise, offer and provide Seller's Services and/or

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20. SURVIVAL OF OBLIGATIONS.</span> Any obligations and duties
                            which by their nature extend beyond the expiration or termination of this Agreement shall survive the
                            expiration or termination of this Agreement.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">21. GOVERNING LAW.</span> This Agreement shall be construed in
                            accordance with, and disputes shall be governed by, the laws of the State of Utah, excluding its conflict of
                            law rules. The Fourth District Court of Utah or the United States District Court for the District of Utah
                            shall have jurisdiction and venue over all controversies arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement. The
                            applicability of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby expressly
                            waived by the parties and it shall not apply to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">22. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; MODIFICATION.</span> This Agreement is the
                            complete, final and exclusive statement of the terms of the Agreement between the parties and supersedes any
                            and all other prior and contemporaneous negotiations and agreements, whether oral or written, between them
                            relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not be varied, modified, altered, or amended
                            except in writing, including a purchase order or a change order issued by Cricut, signed by the parties. The
                            terms and conditions of this Agreement shall prevail notwithstanding any variance with the terms and
                            conditions of any acknowledgment or other document submitted by Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
                            Agreement will not supersede or take the place of any written Agreement which is signed by both parties and
                            covers the same subject matter as this Agreement or its related purchase orders.</p>

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">23. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS.</span> Seller shall comply fully with
                            all applicable federal, state and local laws in the performance of this Agreement. Upon Cricut's request,
                            Seller will promptly provide Cricut with a statement of origin for all Goods and other documents reasonably
                            requested by Cricut in order to effect the import/export of the Goods to the location designated by Cricut.

                        <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">24. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.</span> Seller acknowledges and agrees
                            that the obligations and promises of Seller under this Agreement are of a unique, intellectual nature giving
                            them particular value. Seller's breach of any of the promises contained in this Agreement will result in
                            irreparable and continuing damage to Cricut for which there will be no adequate remedy at law and, in the
                            event of such breach, Cricut will be entitled to seek injunctive relief, or a decree of specific
                            performance.</p>
