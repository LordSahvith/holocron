        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // with Objects
        const person = {

            age: 80
        };
        console.log(person);

        // and think we make a copy:
        const captain = person;
        captain.number = 99;
        console.log(person);

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { days: 99 });
        console.log(person, cap2);

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

            age: 80
        };
